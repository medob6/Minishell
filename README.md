First, we need to agree that having a high-level perspective of the project's structure is essential. Even for a medium-sized project like this, using some design patternsâ€”even simple onesâ€”can make development much smoother and more manageable.

At first glance, we can see that tokenization is a key part of the project, so Iâ€™ll start by creating a tokenizer, which will be our first step.

Next, since weâ€™re building an interactive shell, we need to display a prompt and read user input from the terminal. To achieve this, I created a function to construct the prompt, using getcwd to fetch the current directory and generate a Bash-like prompt.

I've also added two files:

    parsing.c (to handle parsing logic)
    utils.c (for helper functions, placed inside a utils/ folder with clear function names)

Additionally, I introduced some necessary header includes, which should all be placed inside an include/ folder. I also set up a Makefile to manage compilation.

Right now, the structure is basic and rough, but we should build on top of it and refine it step by step.
